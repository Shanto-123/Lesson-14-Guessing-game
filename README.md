# Lesson-14-Guessing-game
This code gives the user 5 attempts to guess the correct price (set as 10). If the user guesses correctly within those attempts, it prints "You have won!" and exits the loop. If all guesses are incorrect, after 5 attempts, it prints "Game Over! You've used all your guesses."
